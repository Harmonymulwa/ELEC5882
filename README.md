# ELEC5882
The Design and Implementation of a Pulse Compression Filter on an FPGA (Cyclone V).
This repository currently contains the MATLAB implementation of a Pulse Compression Filter.
This will be used as a reference and guidance on the type of signals to expect when designing the 
filter on the FPGA.

Furthermore, the folder 'Verilog scripts' currently contains an n-tap FIR filter and an
n-tap complex FIR implmentation in Verilog.
